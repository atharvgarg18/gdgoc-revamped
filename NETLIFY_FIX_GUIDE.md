# 🔧 **NETLIFY PAGE NOT FOUND - IMMEDIATE FIX**

## ❌ **The Problem**
Your Netlify site shows "Page Not Found" because of a build configuration mismatch.

## ✅ **The Solution (I've Fixed It)**

I've updated the `netlify.toml` file to fix the issue:

**Changed:**
- Publish directory: `dist` → `dist/spa` 
- Build command: `npm run build` → `npm run build:client`

---

## 🚀 **What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW**

### **Step 1: Push the Fix to Git**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"
git push
```

### **Step 2: Force Redeploy in Netlify**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Go to **Deploys** tab
3. Click **"Clear cache and deploy site"** (important!)

### **Step 3: Verify Build Settings**
While the new deploy is running, check these settings in Netlify:

1. **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
2. **Build settings** should show:
   - Build command: `npm run build:client`
   - Publish directory: `dist/spa`

If they're different, click **"Edit settings"** and update them.

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong**

The build process creates files in `dist/spa/` but Netlify was looking in `dist/` causing the 404 error.

**Build Output:**
```
dist/spa/index.html         ← Your main file
dist/spa/assets/...         ← CSS and JS files
```

**Netlify was looking in:**
```
dist/index.html             ← Didn't exist!
```

---

## ✅ **After the Fix**

Once you push and redeploy:

1. **Homepage** will load correctly
2. **All routes** (`/events`, `/team`, `/gallery`, `/projects`) will work  
3. **Admin panel** at `/admin` will be accessible
4. **Direct URL access** will work properly

---

## 🧪 **Test These URLs After Deploy**

- `your-site.netlify.app` ← Homepage
- `your-site.netlify.app/events` ← Should work (not 404)
- `your-site.netlify.app/admin` ← Admin panel
- `your-site.netlify.app/team` ← Team page

**All should load without "Page Not Found" errors!**

---

## 📞 **If Still Having Issues**

1. Check Netlify deploy logs for build errors
2. Verify environment variables are set:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Try "Clear cache and deploy site" again

**This fix should resolve the 404 issue immediately! 🎉**
