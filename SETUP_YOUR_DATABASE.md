# 🚀 Quick Database Setup for Your Supabase

Your Supabase connection is now configured! Here's what you need to do:

## ✅ Environment Variables (COMPLETED)
- ✅ VITE_SUPABASE_URL: `https://juifeoegxkiaewdvxuqa.supabase.co`
- ✅ VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Configured securely
- ✅ Dev server restarted with new environment

## 📊 Next: Setup Database Tables

### Step 1: Go to Supabase SQL Editor
1. Open your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/juifeoegxkiaewdvxuqa
2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"New Query"**

### Step 2: Run the Database Setup Script
Copy the entire contents of `database-schema.sql` and paste it into the SQL editor, then click **Run**.

This will create:
- ✅ 4 tables (events, team_members, gallery_items, projects)
- ✅ Sample data with real content
- ✅ Security policies for public access
- ✅ Performance indexes

### Step 3: Test Your Setup
1. Visit `/admin` on your website
2. Use password: `gdgoc2024admin`
3. Try adding/editing content in each tab
4. Check that data appears on your main website pages
